# üåç Global Population Forecasting & Statistical Modeling  

### **"The Rise & Fall of Human Increase" ‚àô 10 Dec 2021**

Large-scale statistical modeling and analysis of the United Nation's world population data as made available in April 2021. Dates covered are 1950-2100.

The census data is 100% complete & organized by ISO location code. ISO codes are also available here for cross-listing purposes. The two datasets were joined in order to discuss population forecasts in terms of currently-titled country names.  

The Methodology .pdf file explains the UN's Dept of Statistics' methods for forecasting populations to 2100, and for explaining data estimation techniques where census data may have been unavailable under certain circumstances.  

Presentation was compiled and executed using slides generated by RMarkdown.  
Report is available as an HTML walkthrough.
