Analysis of World Population data as made available by the United Nations in 2021. Dates covered are 1950-2100.

DATA 2401 (Data Science I) Final Project -- My class partner Rachel Cu & I analyzed the April 2021 release of the UN's dataset containing World Population counts using R. The census data is 100% complete (thanks UN) & organized by ISO location code, available here in the .zip folder for compression. ISO codes are also available here for cross-listing purposes. We joined these two datasets in order to discuss population forecasts by currently-titled country names. The Methodology .pdf file explains the UN's Dept of Statistics methods for forecasting populations to 2100 and where census data may be unavailable in certain instances.
